PhotoShare
==========

This a a very simple camera app that automatically uploads photos to Parse. Once uploaded, a list of all photos can be queried from Parse and viewed within the app.  This app is not intended for public use, it is very rough and the development goal is solely to become more familiar with the uses and limitations of the Parse platform.
